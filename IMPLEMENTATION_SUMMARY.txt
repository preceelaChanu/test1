IMPLEMENTATION FEATURES:
-----------------------
✓ CKKS Homomorphic Encryption (Microsoft SEAL v4.0)
✓ Configurable security parameters (8192/16384/32768 poly degree)
✓ Key Generation Center (Public, Secret, Relinearization keys)
✓ Smart Meter Client simulator with random energy readings
✓ Analytics Server with homomorphic aggregation
✓ Comprehensive performance metrics tracking
✓ Automated test harness for end-to-end testing
✓ JSON-based configuration (no recompilation needed)

KEY COMPONENTS:
--------------
1. keygen.cpp (89 lines)
   - Loads configuration from config.json
   - Creates CKKS encryption parameters
   - Generates and saves cryptographic keys
   - Reports key generation time

2. client.cpp (113 lines)
   - Simulates smart meter energy readings
   - Encrypts data using public key
   - Saves encrypted ciphertexts
   - Reports encryption metrics

3. server.cpp (158 lines)
   - Loads encrypted data from multiple clients
   - Performs homomorphic aggregation
   - Decrypts and displays results
   - Computes total and average consumption

4. CMakeLists.txt
   - Configures build for all three executables
   - Links Microsoft SEAL library
   - Sets C++17 standard

5. config.json
   - Security parameters (poly_modulus_degree, scale_bits)
   - Number of clients to simulate
   - File paths for keys and data

6. run_test.sh
   - Orchestrates complete workflow
   - Cleans old data files
   - Runs keygen → clients → server
   - Error handling and status reporting

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Navigate to the smart_grid_benchmark directory
2. Install Microsoft SEAL v4.0.0 (see README_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
3. Download json.hpp to the include/ directory
4. Build the project: mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
5. Run the automated test: ./run_test.sh

CUSTOMIZATION:
-------------
- Edit config.json to change security level, number of clients
- Modify client.cpp to integrate real London Smart Meter data
- Extend server.cpp for more complex analytics (variance, etc.)
- Adjust run_test.sh for custom testing scenarios

PERFORMANCE METRICS TRACKED:
---------------------------
• Key generation time (ms)
• Encryption time per client (μs)
• Serialization overhead (μs)
• Ciphertext size (bytes)
• Deserialization time (ms)
• Homomorphic computation time (μs)
• Decryption time (μs)
• Numerical precision error

ARCHITECTURE:

    [Key Storage]
    ↓         ↓
[Client]  [Server]
    ↓         ↓
[Encrypted Data]
         ↓
    [Analytics]

The system implements a trusted initialization, untrusted network model
where clients encrypt their energy consumption data before transmission,
and the server performs privacy-preserving analytics without ever seeing
individual readings.
